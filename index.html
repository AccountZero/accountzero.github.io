      <h2 class="display-2 text-center">Whoami</h2>
      <p class="text-center">
        My name is Hubert, and I am a Junior Software Developer with a strong passion for automotive technology and fitness. 
      </p>
      <h2 class="display-2 text-center">Experience with programming</h2>
      <p class="text-wrap"></p>
        TL;DR: I am a Full Stack Developer specializing in Ruby on Rails and HAML, with experience in Java, JavaScript, and Vue.js. I also have foundational knowledge of Haskell and Python.
        <br><br>
        Down here you will find a timeline of my experience.
      </p>
      <h3 class="display-6 text-center">First Project</h3>
      <p class="text-wrap">
        At the age of 15, I created my first application—a calculator—using Visual Basic for Android, which earned me a commendable grade. 
        Although I initially struggled with programming speed, I developed a strong interest in software creation, ultimately leading me to pursue a career as a software developer.
      </p>
      <h3 class="display-6 text-center">Java</h3>
      <p class="text-wrap">
        I began my programming journey with Java at 16, focusing on object-oriented programming for three years in school. 
        While Java's verbose nature and widespread use in Swiss industry justified its inclusion in the curriculum, it also introduced me to some less ideal coding practices.
        Currently, I primarily use Java for Minecraft plugin development. 
        Although I've heard of advanced frameworks like Spring, at 18, I'm still developing my understanding of framework concepts and their applications. 
        Oh and before I forget: Public static void main(String[] args) and it runs on 3 billion devices. 
      </p>
      <h3 class="display-6 text-center">Javascript & Vue + (Ruby) on Rails</h3>
      <p class="text-wrap">
        During my internship, I acquired proficiency in various programming languages that truly inspired me at the age of 19. 
        Over time, I gained a deeper understanding of diverse concepts, significantly enhancing my programming skills. 
      </p>
      <h3 class="display-6 text-center">Haskell, Python & Java again</h3>
      <p class="text-wrap">
        My university studies reintroduced Java and introduced me to Python, a language I had long been eager to explore. 
        While Python is known for its accessibility, it still presented unique learning challenges and opportunities. 
        Its versatility has proven valuable, though I'm seeking more opportunities to apply it practically.
        The curriculum also exposed me to Haskell, introducing me to functional programming—a paradigm I might not have explored independently. 
        Haskell, arguably the most challenging language I've encountered, has significantly broadened my programming perspective.
      </p>
      <h3 class="display-6 text-center">Back at Rails with HAML</h3>
      <p class="text-wrap">
        Returning to Ruby on Rails marked a significant positive shift in my career. This return highlighted my deep appreciation for the framework.
        My current tech stack includes:
        <ul>
          <li>Ruby on Rails</li>
          <li>HAML (HTML Abstraction Markup Language) for view templating within the MVC pattern</li>
        </ul>
        This combination has proven highly effective, and I anticipate continuing with this stack in the near future due to its efficiency and my personal affinity for these technologies.

    <div class="container my-3">
      <h1 class="display-2 text-center">Projects</h1>
      <p class="text-wrap">
        I am currently working on several projects, so I don't have a formal showcase available at this time. 
        While I do have some school projects on my GitHub, they do not fully reflect my current skills and capabilities. 
        Stay tuned for updates!
